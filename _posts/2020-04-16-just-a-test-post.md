I started learning HTML and CSS, as well as all the prerequisite skills no more than 9 months ago, though to say that my time spent was consecutive and always 100% efficient would be a lie.

There were dribs and drabs of not being able to study anything, due to either my clumsiness, or general poor luck, but quite a few times now I have been without a laptop, either broken, lost or stolen.
Though I tried to push on with just my phone, at times it was hard, that's to say the least.

When I began studying Web Development I was living in Korea, with my now ex girlfriend, a lovely girl, and now looking back on, I would have spent my life with had I not come back to Australia for personal matters. Korea, a place full of ambitious, effervescent, young people, was the perfect place to start down a new career path.
Living in Seoul, and seeing day to day how competitive the society was gave me new motivation to be successful in this challenging world.

Now, back in Australia, after another 3 months with no access to technology I was finally able to get my hands on laptop again, a chunky Lenovo Thinkpad T420. Even though it is an older model, it has enough grunt to get my current workload done, though it will be interesting to see in the future if it will be able to handle compiling code.

With my new laptop in hand, I could finally start studying again, and in the last week or so have been able to complete a Gallery Page and a Blog for the website that was only meant to be a part of a tutorial site for the Learnenoughâ„¢ series of courses.

However after putting all the work into making this site, it would seem such a shame to see it sit and collect dust.
So Instead it seems that I will use it for my personal thoughts, day to day going-on of general life, Web Dev, and maybe a story or two. To whomever may stumble across this blog, stay tuned, I may post again soon...
